TPS 1:
1. A procedure is a function that doesn't return a value. A function returns a value does not always need to.
Lastly, a method is a function that is a class of functions that use object orientation.
4. The line that calls SUM is line 20. This line is the label for the subroutine that adds the two variables
to get the sume.
5. We cannot not use j, we are unable to call the function multiple times in which we may need to go to.
6. The return address is supposed to be saved in $ra. The value that is being saved here is 0. This does not
make sense.
7. When trying to run the program, an error occurs regarding the program counter value.
8. The address of the statemnt should be 0x00400020.
10. The new return address is 0x00400028. The output of the program is 15.
11. The operator that we should use is jal.

TPS 2:
1. The output of the program would be 38.
3. When MAIN calls SUM, SUM knows where to return as the return is being handled and stored automatically into
$ra using the jal operator. The return address of SUM is beig changed to what is being held in SUB.
5. The original value is being replaced by the value of m. This is a proble, as it alters the input value that
is being used for the program to be excuted properly.
