Assignment 1
1. The line that caused the segmentation fault is line 18 of the program.
2. To fix the line properly, we would reference input rather which creates an array
of integers to be referenced to.
3. The bug here is that the function is not accessing the values of the array and
adding them to a variable for the sum of the values.
4. To fix this bug, we create memory addresses for sum to be accessed and added to in
order to find the average of the inputted integers.

Assignment 2
1. The output is not as expected. We are trying to append one string to another but
the second string is being repeated at the end.
2. The output is not as expected. The program is holding onto the previous string and
replacing where the previous characters were.
3. The output is not as expected. I think that the output results from the appended
strings are being repeated due to memory related issues where the memory is being
duplicated.
