TPS 1:
1. Cache is a reserved storage where temporary data is stored for quick data retrieval. We need cache
to speed up our applications and improve the efficiency of the application by having temporary data
that can be accessed quickly.

2. Two methodfs of organizing a cache:
    a. Direct-mapped
    b. N-way set associative 

4. 4 bits are required to offset a 16B block of cache. THe number of bits in offset as a function
is log_2(16). It is not practical to have a cache of block size 1B.

5. We need 6 index bits. The number of bits a function of number of blocks is log_2(64).

6. To know the total size of the cache, you would have divide the number of cache by the block size.

7. The left over bits are used to determine the sign of the tag. They are important for finding
certain data that is stored in the cache and different blocks are mapped to the same spot in the 
main memory.

8. 
a. Main memory: 2^20 = 1 million bytes
b. Offset bits: log_2(8) = 3 bits
c. Number of blocks: 128/8 = 16 blocks
d. Number of index bits: log_2(16) = 4 bits
e. Number of tag bits: 13 bits
   ___________
f. |13 1 1 8B|
   -----------
   |         | Total of 16 Blocks
   |         |
   ___________
g. 79 bits/row

TPS2: 
1. The disadvantage of direct-mapped cache is a the data being mapped to the same spot. The cache 
miss that direct-mapped introduces is a crash miss.

3. We need 8 bits for the index. log_2(1024/4)

4.
a. Main memory: 2^20 = 1 million bytes 
b. Offset bits: log_2(8) = 3 bits
c. Number of blocks: 128/8 = 16 blocks
d. Number of sets: 8 sets
e. Numbers of index bits: log_2(8) = 3 bits
f. NUmber of tag bits: 20-3-3 = 14 bits
   ___________
g. |14 1 1 8B| 2 block sets
   |         |
   -----------
   |         | Total of 16 Blocks
   |         |
   ___________
h. 80 bits/row
