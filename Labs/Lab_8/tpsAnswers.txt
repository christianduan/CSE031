TPS 1:
5. We do not need to declare n in the .data segment. We also do not need to declare the la and lw instructions.

TPS 2:
1. The program would output 29 if 5 were to be entered.
2. The main functions in recusion.s asks that user for input and takes input. It then takes the input and jumps
and links to the recursion fucntion.
4. We should use the register "$a0"
5. The register that we expect is $v0. We can move $v0 into a different temporary register that can be used later
7. The first thing that we is in the stack is the register $ra. 
10. We need to save $a0 into the stack as we are using it for the next recursion call.
12. The return values will be replaced after each call of recursion.
15. The return value is the value that is being stored in $v0.
